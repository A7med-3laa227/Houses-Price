## House Price Analysis and Prediction using Machine Learning
Overview
This project focuses on analyzing house prices and building a machine learning model to predict house prices using the provided dataset. The notebook performs detailed data exploration, cleaning, and model development to estimate the sale price of houses based on various attributes.

Project Structure
1. Data Collection and Understanding
The dataset includes 1460 rows and 80 columns. Key features include:

LotFrontage, LotArea: Dimensions of the lot.
OverallQual, OverallCond: Overall quality and condition ratings of the house.
YearBuilt, YearRemodAdd: Construction and remodeling years.
SalePrice: The target variable representing the sale price.
2. Data Preprocessing
The notebook covers the following preprocessing steps:

Handling missing data: Identified and imputed missing values in columns like LotFrontage, GarageYrBlt, and categorical features such as Alley.
Feature engineering: New features were created, and categorical variables were converted to numerical values using techniques like one-hot encoding.
Scaling numerical values: Features such as LotArea and SalePrice were normalized for better model performance.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Distribution plots: Visualized the distribution of features such as SalePrice, GrLivArea, and LotArea using histograms and box plots.
Correlation analysis: Explored the relationship between features and target variable using heatmaps and pair plots. Features like OverallQual and YearBuilt showed high correlation with SalePrice.
4. Model Development
Multiple machine learning models were implemented to predict house prices:

Linear Regression: A baseline model to understand linear relationships between features and target.
Decision Tree and Random Forest: Tree-based models were used to capture non-linear interactions.
Gradient Boosting and XGBoost: Advanced ensemble techniques were applied to improve performance.
5. Model Evaluation
Models were evaluated using metrics such as:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
R-squared score (RÂ²) The best model was chosen based on these metrics.
6. Model Tuning
Hyperparameter tuning was performed using GridSearchCV to optimize the parameters of the chosen models, enhancing prediction accuracy.
